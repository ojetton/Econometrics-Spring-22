## Question 1

```{r Data}
data = read.csv("data-001.csv")

```


## Question 2

```{r Regression}

reg1 = lm(data = data,
          formula = income_black_2010 ~ pop_enslaved_1860 + pop_total_1860 + pop_total_2010)

q2_coef = reg1$coefficients[["pop_enslaved_1860"]]

summary(reg1)
```

The coefficient on "pop_enslaved_1860" is `r q2_coef`
This tells us that as the population of enslaved individuals of a county in 1860 increases by 1, the median income for black households in 2010 in that county changes by $ `r q2_coef`

## Question 3

```{r Matrix Regression}
# endogenous variable
Y = as.matrix(data$income_black_2010)

# exogenous variables (with intercept)
X = matrix(c(rep(1, 710), data$pop_enslaved_1860, data$pop_total_1860, data$pop_total_2010), 
                    ncol = 4)

reg_q3 = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% Y

reg_q3[2,1]
```

The coefficient on "pop_enslaved_1860" is `r reg_q3[2,1]` which is the same as in question 2.


## Question 4

```{r Regression Function}

reg_fun = function(y, x) {
  coef = solve(t(x) %*% x) %*% t(x) %*% y
  
  return(coef)
}
```

Results:

```{r}
reg_fun(Y, X)

```

Success!

## Question 5

```{r Regression function With Standard Errors}

reg_fun2 = function(y, x) {
  
  # coefficient equation
  coef = solve(t(x) %*% x) %*% t(x) %*% y
  
  # standard errors
    # error (residuals)
  e = (y - x %*% coef)
    # variance sigma estimate calculation
  s_sq = (1/(dim(x)[1] - dim(x)[2]-1))*sum(e^2)
  
  # calculate variance matrix
  variance_matrix = s_sq * solve(t(x) %*% x)
  
  # arrange the results
  stnd_errors = sqrt(diag(variance_matrix))
  
  results = cbind(coef, stnd_errors)
  
  return(results)
  
}

```

Results:

```{r}
reg_fun2(Y, X)

```

My function reports the coefficients and standard errors correctly.

## Question 6

To be approximately correct, the standard errors reported from my function rely on the assumptions of homoskedasticity, nonautocorrelation, and normally distributed errors: 
$$\epsilon | X \sim N(0, \sigma^2 I) $$

## Question 7

In order for my coefficients to be interpretable as causal, one needs to assume that the model we're estimating is the true model, that there are no omitted relevant variables, that the exogenous variables are in fact *exogenous*.



## Extra Credit

```{r Extra Credit}

reg_fun3 = function(data, var_y, var_x) {

  y = as.matrix(data %>% select(all_of(var_y)))
  
  x = as.matrix(cbind(intercept = c(rep(1, length(y))), 
                      data %>% select(all_of(var_x))))
  
  # coefficient equation
  coef = solve(t(x) %*% x) %*% t(x) %*% y
  
  # standard errors
    # error (residuals)
  e = (y - x %*% coef)
    # standard error calculation
  s_sq = (1/(dim(x)[1] - dim(x)[2]-1))*sum(e^2)
  
  # calculate variance matrix
  variance_matrix = s_sq * solve(t(x) %*% x)
  
  # arrange the results
  stnd_errors = sqrt(diag(variance_matrix))
  
  results = cbind(coef, stnd_errors)
  
  return(results)
  
}
```

# Results:

```{r Extra Credit Results}
reg_fun3(data = data, 
         var_y = c("income_black_2010"), 
         var_x = c("pop_enslaved_1860", "pop_total_1860", "pop_total_2010")
)

```

Success!
